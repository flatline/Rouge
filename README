This is a small personal project of building a rougelike game using javascript/canvas.  As JS engines have gotten significantly faster over recent years, I thought it would be fun to build a realtime (or pseudo-realtime) game and see how many concurrent actors I could have doing interesting things.

The project has a thin Google AppEngine wrapper, currently just hosting static content.   At some point I will aim for online game storage but currently it is using localStorage for persistence and there is only a stubbed-out REST endpoint for saving games.

Current status: not much to look at right now
 - There is a basic MVC structure in place for the core of the game
 - There is a basic test page at main.htm.  I plan on building out a number of different, similar pages to develop and test different aspects of the game before starting in on world generation and overarching plotlines, if it ever gets that far.
 - Saving games works but there are probably some issues around saving/restoring timing info in the controller.
 - There's not much in the way of graphics, it's currently using a couple items from the standard nethack tileset, I will probably stick with something similar and upload a more complete set in the near future.
